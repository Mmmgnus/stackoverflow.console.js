# Give credit to the Stack Oveflow entries that helped you build the site

My initial though was to create a easter egg â€” some hidden facts or information about the site "only" visible in dev tools of the browser. This information is perfect in a human.txt file but I want to display the information in the console. Human.txt is not made for machines and robots.txt is strange and old.

I'm not sure where the information should live. At the moment the information is inside a JSON file called info.json.

This is how it looks in Chrome.
